NAME
          map - apply in parallel command to each argument.

SYNOPSIS
          map command [ arg... ]

DESCRIPTION
          Map executes the separate program command once for each
          arg, passing it as the last argument. Map dispatches all these
          commands in parallel, and waits for them all to finish before
          exiting.
