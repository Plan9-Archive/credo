Fix reported¹ and recognized² bugs.

All os calls in env, dep, and do scripts should use $osdir.

Add examples from “Recursive Make Considered Harmful” as tests.

Add unicode substitution productions for various languages.¹
Start with the unicoper toascii.sed scripts.²
 ¹ (c sed uc c)
(go sed ugo go)
(haskell sed uhs hs)
(python sed upy py)
(ruby sed urb rb)

Add version files in each /lib/do directory, to version these scripts.
For productions copied from other tools, store the version of the tool.

Add productions from Posix make in mkdir /github/credo/lib/do/sh-inferno/make, since it is the
standardized project management tool.

Add productions from GNU make in /lib/do/gnumake, since it is a
standard project management tool.

Port to bash so it's not limited to Inferno users.  In addition to the
credo tool scripts, all the library do scripts are also written for
Inferno's sh.  How to keep these two versions coherent?
If we automatically translate or add an abstraction layer, then we
lose the advantage that as scripts, they are completely changeable by
the user, who is likely to want to add things I don't know about.
The bash version is likely to be much more popular, and get forks
and changes, so I could just cherry-pick which changes I really like
and back-port them to the Inferno files.

Consider GNU parallel for map in bash port.

Consider porting to dash instead of bash, since it’s a newer de facto
linux shell.

For shell haters, consider a Python port.  Not Perl.

For speed, and to embed concurrency, consider a C or Go port.
Go would be better for concurrency.  Not C++ or Java.

See where we could use ⁱ instead of manually checking each *.dep line,
possibly as a quick check before loading and processing the *.dep file.
 ⁱ sha1sum -c $target.dep.tmp	# first resolve $t, $targ, $target
