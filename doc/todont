Don't move output and intermediate do files to a (hidden) subdirectory
for credo.  To compile source code from another directory, use the
shell variable credir to specify the path to the source.

Don't add redo-* commands to the do scripts.¹  They are a source of
complexity,² and they hide the internal mechanisms and information the
build tool uses to decide what to do.  Credo instead uses *.dep files
to record file-level dependencies.
 ¹ This is the primary difference between credo and redo.
 ² I think that as a whole, their level of abstraction and usage is
complex enough to prevent automatically generating the build system.
It doesn’t help much to have a system just as complex and hand-
written, only divided into smaller files.

Don’t capture the standard output of a do script as the content of
the new file.  This is another difference between credo and redo.

Don’t clean files automatically, in case someone wants to generate and
deliver or compare variants.
