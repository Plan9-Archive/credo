Add version files in each /lib/do directory, to version these scripts.
For productions copied from other tools, store the version of the tool.

Add productions from GNU make in /lib/do/gmake, since it is a standard
build tool for C and C++ build systems.

Port to bash so it's not limited to Inferno users.  In addition to the
credo tool scripts, all the library do scripts are also written for
Inferno's sh.  How to keep these two versions coherent?
If we automatically translate or add an abstraction layer, then we
lose the advantage that as scripts, they are completely changeable by
the user, who is likely to want to add things I don't know about.
The bash version is likely to be much more popular, and get forks
and changes, so I could just cherry-pick which changes I really like
and back-port them to the Inferno files.
