To add credo to an installation of Inferno, clone this repository,
then run these bind commands.

	bind -a $credohome/lib /lib
	bind -a $credohome/man /man
	bind -a $credohome/sh-inferno /dis
	bind -a $credohome/test /test

credohome¹ should contain the path to the credo repository, as written
in Inferno.  For example, from the host’s point of view, if the credo
repository is cloned under $emuroot in ², then credohome is ³ within
Inferno.  If instead it is cloned in ⁴, and the host filesystem is
bound to /n/local, then credohome is ⁵.
 ¹ $credohome is here a convenience; credo itself doesn’t use it.  
 ² /usr/inferno/github/credo
 ³ /github/credo
 ⁴ /opt/src/github/credo
 ⁵ /n/local/opt/src/github/credo
