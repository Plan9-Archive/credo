Credo calls scripts to create files, after doing the same for files on
which they depend.  Dodep instantiates, from a library, parts of such
a system of file-creating scripts and dependencies.

Credo is an adaptation of the build tool redo, by D.J. Bernstein.

Another implementation in python is redo, by Avery Pennarun.
