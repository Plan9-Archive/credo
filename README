DESCRIPTION

Credo calls scripts to create files, after doing the same for files on
which they depend.  Dodep copies templates of those scripts, and lists
of default dependencies, from a library, and customizes them for a
given target.

Credo is a set of small shell scripts, which stores its data (such as
a checksum for each file on which a target depends) in flat files in
the current directory.  This creates clutter, but also an interface
for higher-level tools.

Credo is currently only implemented in Infernoâ€™s sh: I really like its
shell language (especially apply, <{}, and quoting rules); and Inferno
exposes all the shell variables of a process as files in /env, which
makes writing dependencies on them much simpler.  I expect that it
will need a port to Linux for wider adoption, either as shell scripts
or a program.

How credo handles manual changes to generated files; default do scripts.

Credo example: from lex and c source to cygwin executable, across directories.

One change since the example is new addenv/rmenv commands, to
manage target dependencies on environment variables.  For example,
these commands can replace the echo commands in the example:

	addenv default srcdir ../src/
	addenv default cpp cpp-3
	addenv default cppflags -I../src/
	addenv default cc gcc-3


RELATED WORK

Credo is an adaptation of the build tool redo, by D.J. Bernstein.
http://cr.yp.to/redo.html

Another implementation in python is redo, by Avery Pennarun.
https://github.com/apenwarr/redo

The most significant differences from Avery's redo is that there are
no redo-* commands in the do scripts; credo has a new set of shell
commands to create, examine, and maintain the build system
(for higher-level tools to automatically generate a build system);
and credo exposes all of its record-keeping in flat files in the
current directory.
